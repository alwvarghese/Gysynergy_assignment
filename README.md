# Azure ETL Pipeline
## Overview
This project aims to demonstrate the process of performing ETL on raw data from Azure Blob storage to databricks for analysis purposes. The ETL process involves using Azure Databricks for data extraction, transformation and agrregation. I have used databricks workflows to orchestrate data movement, and Delta Lake for storing staged data for analytical purposes.
